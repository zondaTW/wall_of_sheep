# django-fresh

django-fresh will auto-refresh your browser whenever you update to any of the
files in your project. Very useful for development, not intended for
production!


## How It Works

django-fresh injects a small piece of JavaScript into each of your HTML pages
which will then make the page poll your Django app checking if files were
changed. If django-fresh sees that you modified a file it will tell the next
polling to refresh the page.


## Setup

 1. Install fresh by running `pip install django-fresh`.
 2. In `settings.py` add `fresh` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
 3. In `settings.py` add `fresh.middleware.FreshMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.
 4. In `settings.py` have `SITE_ROOT` variable set to the absolute path of your projects files.
 5. In `urls.py` add `url(r'', include('fresh.urls'))` to `urlpatterns`.

### `SITE_ROOT` Example

This will dynamically grab the location of your settings file and make it your
site root, django-fresh will recursively watch everything in the settings file's
folder.

    SITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

**Note:** Be sure you `import os` before using the above code or you'll get an
error!


## Optional Custom Settings

You have two customizable choices:

 1. `FRESH_ACCEPTED_EXTENSIONS` is an array that is checked when files are updated, if an extension is not in the list it won't trigger a refresh.
 2. `FRESH_IGNORED_PAGES` is an array that is checked before injecting the refresh code, if page in list it won't have the code injected. 

### `FRESH_ACCEPTED_EXTENSIONS` Defaults

    FRESH_ACCEPTED_EXTENSIONS = [
        '.py',
        '.html',
        '.js',
        '.css',
    ]

### `FRESH_IGNORED_PAGES` Defaults

    FRESH_IGNORED_PAGES = [
        '/admin/',
        '/admin_keywords_submit/',
    ]


## Notice

django-fresh checks to see if `debug` is `True`, if it is `False` it doesn't do
anything to prevent you from accidently including it in production.
